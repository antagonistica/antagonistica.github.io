# About

This blog is not about me so it doesn't really matter who I am.
In all briefness: I do a bit of development, a bit of operations and some research in AI.
I spend a lot of time learning and talking about Bitcoin and I started to get interested in *FOSS* in general.
Privacy and information security are very important topics to me and I'm constantly learning how to improve them in my own (digital) life.
I'm a *cypherpunk* at heart.

## How this blog was created

Many thanks to Jeremy Howard for that!
