Welcome to my blog where I write about *FOSS* software and what you can do with it!
My plan is to write down what I learned while I tried to achieve some goal myself.
While this may help me to organize and remember things it may also be helpful for other people.
Hopefully also for you!
I plan to mainly write down information that would've helped me myself.
In this way I hope to give something back to the amazing *FOSS* community.
