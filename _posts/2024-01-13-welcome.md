# Welcome to my blog!

## What to expect

This blog is mainly for me to write down interesting learnings or findings surrounding my interests in Computer Science and technology.
But I figured some of them might be interesting to other people too, so you're welcome to look around.
Since this blog has no specific topic here is a list of things that I'm currently interested in:

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
- Open source AI
- Freedom technology like:
    - [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/)
    - [Nostr](https://nostr.com/)
- Privacy supporting software like:
    - [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)
    - [SimpleX](https://simplex.chat/)
    - [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
